Hi! [@nsg](https://github.com/nsg/) is my personal GitHub account. I love Linux, I have been using it since the 90s and running it full time for about 15 years, and about 10 professionally. From time to time I may commit as my employer, for more about that see the [extended profile](https://nsg.github.io/).
